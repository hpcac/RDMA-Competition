# RDMA-Competition

The HPC Advisory Council, a leading organization for high-performance computing research, outreach and education, announced that the HPC Advisory Council will organize The Sixth Student RDMA Programming Competition starting on May 22, 2018。

It is designed for undergraduates to study RMDA and is also an excellent opportunity for RDMA programming experts to demonstrate their talents. The competition was first held in 2013 which attracted enrollment in more than 20 colleges and universities from across the country. In the last competition held in 2017, it attracted more than 50 colleges and universities to enroll and received wide attention from experts of international high-performance computing, cloud computing, and big data.

In this year’s competition, we want to announce more challenge topic about the RDMA programming: NoSQL Applications
